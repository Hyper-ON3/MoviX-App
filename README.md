# MoviX App
MoviX is a mobile application created using Swift that utilizes the MVVM + Coordinator architecture pattern. It uses various third-party libraries such as Alamofire, SDWebImage, Realm, RxSwift, and Lottie to provide users with a seamless and intuitive movie browsing experience.

# Features
Movie search: Users can search for movies by title or keywords, and the app will display the relevant results.
Top-rated and newly released movies: Users can browse through a list of top-rated and newly released movies.
Movie details: The app displays movie details such as a brief description, release date, rating, and cast. Users can also watch trailers of the movie.
Favorites: Users can save movies to their favorites list and access them easily.
# Technology Stack
The following technologies were used to build the MoviX App:

MVVM + Coordinator architecture: This architecture pattern helps separate the presentation logic from the business logic, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
Alamofire: This library simplifies network requests, making it easy to fetch data from remote APIs.
SDWebImage: This library provides asynchronous image downloading and caching, making it easy to load images into the app.
Realm: This library provides a fast, lightweight, and easy-to-use database to store movie data, including favorites.
RxSwift: This reactive programming library provides an elegant and powerful way to handle data flow between different components of the app.
Lottie: This library provides high-quality animations for the app, enhancing the user experience.
# Installation
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the MoviX.xcodeproj file in Xcode.
Install the third-party libraries using CocoaPods.
Build and run the app on a simulator or a physical device.
# Usage
Upon launching the app, users are presented with the home screen, which includes a search bar, a list of top-rated and newly released movies, and a button to access the favorites list. Users can search for movies by entering a title or keywords in the search bar. The app will display the relevant results, including the movie title, poster, rating, and release year. Users can tap on a movie to view its details, including the description, cast, and trailer. They can also add the movie to their favorites list by tapping on the heart icon.

# Credits
The app uses the The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch movie data. The app also uses various third-party libraries such as Alamofire, SDWebImage, Realm, RxSwift, and Lottie.
